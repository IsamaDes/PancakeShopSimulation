# ðŸ¥ž PancakeShopSimulation

PancakeShopSimulation is a Java simulation that models how a pancake shop serves customers under resource constraints.  
It explores questions like:

- How many pancakes are wasted if demand is low?
- What happens when demand exceeds supply?
- Can different serving strategies reduce waste or improve fairness?

This project is structured with Maven and organized into modular packages (`model`, `service`, `strategy`, `ui`) so it can grow into a full-featured application (e.g., with JavaFX or REST API support).
